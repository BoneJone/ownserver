How to setup your own server as a student for free using Digital Ocean and Namecheap  
Github offers so called student pack, which includes credit coupons to Digital Ocean and Namecheap. Digital Ocean and namecheap have been widely used already before this offer. Digital Ocean is a cloud VPS (Virtual Service Provider) and namecheap gives DNS mappings. Due to lack of time these instructions are not written for a newbie level.  
  

Some Digital Ocean “wiki” pages are good.  
  

Go to https://education.github.com/pack  
Click "get your pack". Getting the pack might take couple of hours or might be ready instantly.  
Sign in to github with your github account which you must create if you did not have one already  
Find Namecheap under student pack  
Get promocode and use it at Namecheap  
Setup DNS as following at namecheap:  
Domains -> Registration  
Click Manage on domain at Domain List  
Nameservers, select Custom DNS and add followint nameservers:  
ns1.digitalocean.com  
ns2.digitalocean.com  
ns3.digitalocean.com

Store promotion code to be inserted to Digital Ocean to get service for free  
Use that code of Digital Ocean ordering site

Log into your droplet using Putty SSH as root. Remove from sshd config remote root logins, create user account for yourself using adduser command. Add using visudo root permissions to your account.  
  

Disable remote root logins from ssh.  
sudo nano -w sshd_config  
/etc/ssh/PermitRootLogin no  
  

sudo service sshd reload
